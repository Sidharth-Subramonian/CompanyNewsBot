## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. User Input → NLP → Company Names
- Extracts company names using spaCy NER
- Applies fuzzy matching against KNOWN_COMPANIES list
- Filters out generic words like “news”, “report”, “give”

### 2. Company → Google Search → Top 3 Links
- googlesearch-python used to get latest links for that company
- Not restricted to 1-day or 7-day filters — fetches current latest news results

### 3. Scraping & Summarization
- Scrapes article paragraphs using BeautifulSoup
- Summarizes using sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6 via Hugging Face Transformers
- Summaries styled as Formal, Casual, or Bullet Points

### 4. Chat Response
- Summarized news displayed per company
- If content fails, links are shown under "📎 Additional Links"
